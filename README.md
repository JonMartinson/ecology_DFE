Repo for data, code, and figures for paper, "Metabolic mutualism increases genetic robustness by reducing the severity of gene disruptions"


In order to recreate the analyses/figures in Martinson & Chacon 2023, download the repo and then open the DFE_analysis.Rproj.

The files genes.GC and all.poolcount are derived from the FEBA barseq pipeline described in Wetmore 2015. 

The gene annotations are from uniprot.

###NOTE####

The all.poolcounts file is too big to upload to github so we'll have to figure out another way to add the data.
