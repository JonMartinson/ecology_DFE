# ecology_DFE
Repo for data, code, and figures for "Metabolic mutualism increases genetic robustness by reducing the severity of gene disruptions"


In order to recreate the analyses/figures in Martinson & Chacon 2023, download the repo and then open the DFE_analysis.Rproj.

The files genes.GC and all.poolcount are derived from the FEBA barseq pipeline described in Wetmore 2015. 

The gene annotations are from uniprot. 

# instructions go here --> 

###NOTE####

The all.poolcounts file is too big to upload to github so we'll have to figure out another way to add the data. 

### ADD figure numbers on later draft ###

The wetlab_growth.R script contains analysis for the wet lab components of the experiment --> number of generations, species fitness, and total population size (Figures XX, YY, ZZ).

The gse_barseq.R script contains the gene set enrichment analysis and figures (Figure XX).

The barseq_scatterplots_different_models_of_predicted_effect.R contains the analysis for fig 2. 

The plot_individual_gene_fitness.R script contains the code to generate figures X, Y, Z.
